Initially, the focus will be on the support of needy pupils transitioning to Secondary Education after passing the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination given the relatively large number of students who drop out of the school system due to lack of fees. A background discussion on the situation of the education sub-sector in Khwisero and Gem Sub-Counties and the proposed mechanism of carrying out support has been elaborated.

The general educational standard especially the number of pupils transitioning to Secondary Education from Khwisero and Gem Sub-Counties have been declining over the years. The situation has come about due to various factors:
<br><i class="icon-right-dir" style="color: #2ab574;"></i>    Neglect of this important service by community leaders and weakness of the national government educational administration system
<br><i class="icon-right-dir" style="color: #2ab574;"></i>    Limited budgetary provision from the national government for the educational programs since education sector from primary to University is a function of the National government
<br><i class="icon-right-dir" style="color: #2ab574;"></i>    Poor remuneration of teachers resulting in poor motivation to perform. 
<br><i class="icon-right-dir" style="color: #2ab574;"></i>    Large number of pupils sitting and qualifying for limited chances in public secondary schools
<br><i class="icon-right-dir" style="color: #2ab574;"></i>    High poverty levels of the rural based community members
<br><i class="icon-right-dir" style="color: #2ab574;"></i>    High number of orphaned children as a result of the high prevalence of HIV/Aids in the Sub-Counties.
<br><i class="icon-right-dir" style="color: #2ab574;"></i>    Lack of gainful economic activities in the two communities


                                                                </p>
                                                                <p>
                                                                    This situation is not unique to Khwisero and Gem Sub-Counties but is widespread in the four counties of Nyanza region region namely Homa-Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. The same applies to the western regions namely Kakamega, Vihiga, Busia and Bungoma.  If left unchecked, the pupils dropping out of school are likely to be a social liability in the future since with no proper income and having become adults such persons can very easily turn to crime for their survival or adopt other undesirable lifestyle like prostitution for girls, abuse of alcohol and use of hard drugs e.g smoking of bhang. Girls are also faced with the prospects of early marriages to poor husbands resulting in recycled poverty environment. On average, about 20% of the pupils who sit the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education Examination in Gem Sub-County and an estimated 23% from Khwisero Sub-County fail to join Secondary schools due to lack of school fees or early pregnancy for girls. Given the increasing number of pupils who sit the KCPE, the situation is expected to keep worsening since currently, there are no mitigating mechanisms put in place to address this problem.

Needy here refers to those pupils from very poor families whose parents/guardians are poor and do not have immediate relatives who can pay for their Secondary Education. The number of pupils identified and supported would increase in future should the Foundation be successful in getting financial support from other well-wishers or philanthropists. Although the suggested intervention will be minimal, it will be the beginning of addressing a very important socio-economic need in the two local regions. Lack of education is a drawback to the economic progress of a community and to the country in general.

Such a process is necessary so that those pupils who will end up being selected will have gone through a thorough vetting process to prevent the infiltration of corrupt practices. Emphasis will be placed on equal chance for boys and girls, that is to say that if two chances are availed for a Ward, one of the beneficiaries must be a girl unless a situation arises where one of the gender is unavailable for consideration. If such a situation is encountered, the Foundation’s management will make appropriate decisions depending on the circumstances of the cases involved.
The overall factors for potential consideration for support will however be: Good performance, Admission to a public Secondary School, Good discipline and Confirmed Lack of wherewithal to get school fees to finance the four years of Secondary Education. This program will start with students joining Form One and will run the entire course of secondary school education.
