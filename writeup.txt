Who We Are 
The Impact Foundation is a Kenyan registered Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) having been registered on August 25th, 2014 under the Society’s Act, Chapter 108 Laws of Kenya. The founders of the Foundation are Mr. Adams Omondi Kisoka and his spouse Mrs. Nelly Aloo Omondi all of whom are Kenya citizens currently owning and managing a private chemicals based products manufacturing business under the name of Impact Chemicals Limited. 

Why we Help
The Impact Foundation founded largely to carry out the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) functions of Impact Chemicals Company as a means of giving back to their ancestral community in Gem Sub-County, Siaya County through livelihood value adding programs that has been the desire of the founders for sometime having been relatively successful in their education and business venture. This desire is expected to be realized through the Foundation’s proposed socio-economic activities of which, the key one will be contribution towards the improvement of educational standard in Gem and Khwisero Sub-Counties by among others, offering financial support to bright standard eight pupils who have performed well in their Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) Examination but are unable to continue with their Secondary Education due to lack of school fees; support of women empowerment programs; establishment of youth development activities; and participation in various other socio-economic activities designed to improve the social and economic lives of the communities resident in the two sub-counties named above.  


The Founders
Mr Omondi is a Kenyan citizen with a University degree in Chemistry obtained from University of Nairobi. After his graduation, he worked briefly with various chemical and pharmaceutical companies in Nairobi before venturing in private business. Jointly with his spouse, they registered Impact Chemicals Company Limited in the year 2000 to manufacture Cleaning Detergents and Antiseptics for domestic and industrial usage. They have since diversified their products to include pharmaceuticals for hospital use.  

Nelly Omondi is a teacher by profession but has since 2000 together with her husband been involved in the management of their business as pointed out above. She is a director of the company and largely manages the marketing and administrative functions while her husband along with other professionals is involved in production and research activities. 

Nelly is a member of The Organisation of Women in International Trade(OWIT) from where she has gained useful knowledge of business networking. As a result of this membership, she was in early 2015 selected and attended the Fortune/US State Department Global Women’s Mentorship Program for four weeks. This was a real eye opener for her given the large number of participants and practical involvement in various case studies. It is expected that Nelly will apply her good experience in networking in the management of The Impact Foundation especially in the identification of potential financial supporters.

Target COmmunity
The founders’ desire is to initially concentrate the Foundation’s operational area in their home Sub-County of Gem which is among the Parliamentary constituencies in the greater Nyanza Region. The reason for this selection is that the founders would like to give back to their immediate community the benefits of their success in education and  business before expanding the services to other nearby Sub-Counties where the demand for such services are equally high. The beneficiaries of the Foundation’s activities may spread to the neighbouring Khwisero Sub-County in Kakamega County due to the fact that the two counties share services like schools, markets and churches. However, the main target will be to concentrate on Gem Sub-County since this is the birth place of the founders where they maintain their rural home.  

Gem is a Sub-County of Siaya County and is a Parliamentary Constituency represented in the Kenyan National Assembly by an elected representative. It is subdivided into five Wards each having an elected Ward Representative at the County Assembly in Siaya town. 
The Sub-County’s economy is characterized by subsistence agriculture where crops cultivated are inclusive of maize, sorghum, cassava, beans, horticultural crops, sweet potatoes and to a lesser extent sugarcane for mill white sugar. Commercial farming activities in the Sub-County is minimal given the lack of industrial crops like coffee and tea but some farmers do keep dairy cattle for milk production. Manufacturing activities are also minimal since most of the manufactured products are sourced from Kisumu city at a distance of about 60 kilometres. Lack of industries and minimal commercial farming has negatively affected the socio-economic lives of the residents of the Sub-County resulting in widespread poverty among the residents.  
HIV/Aids prevalence in the Sub-county is also a hindrance to its economic development since a large number of those dying of the disease are young people who leave behind orphans under the care of old grandparents or guardians with no reliable source of income for survival. Under these circumstances, financing of Secondary Education for pupils who have passed the KCPE exam is a real challenge for such families hence, the large number of primary school level drop outs. Supply of adequate food is also a big problem for these poor families – a situation which adversely affects the performance of pupils in primary schools since a hungry pupil is likely not to have undivided attention in class while some miss school to look for menial jobs for survival. 
The socio-economic environment of Gem Sub-County as explained above is one characterized of poverty among its residents and a high prevalence of HIV/Aids. Carrying out of meaningful community development is therefore a big challenge for the leaders given the limited budgetary allocation of the National and County governments. Support from the non- governmental organizations like this one being proposed by The Impact Foundation will therefore go a long way in enhancing the government effort in the provision of vital services like improvement of educational standard as discussed below.
